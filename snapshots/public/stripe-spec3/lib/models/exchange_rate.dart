/// 
/// *`[Note: this integration path is supported but no longer recommended]`* Additionally,
/// you can guarantee that a charge is made with an exchange rate that you expect is
/// current. To do so, you must pass in the exchange_rate to charges endpoints. If the
/// value is no longer up to date, the charge won't go through. Please refer to our
