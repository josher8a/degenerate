import 'package:degenerate_runtime/degenerate_runtime.dart';/// Only applies to subscriptions with `collection_method=charge_automatically`.
/// 
/// Use `allow_incomplete` to create Subscriptions with `status=incomplete` if the first invoice can't be paid. Creating Subscriptions with this status allows you to manage scenarios where additional customer actions are needed to pay a subscription's invoice. For example, SCA regulation may require 3DS authentication to complete payment. See the [SCA Migration Guide](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication) for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.
/// 
/// Use `default_incomplete` to create Subscriptions with `status=incomplete` when the first invoice requires payment, otherwise start as active. Subscriptions transition to `status=active` when successfully confirming the PaymentIntent on the first invoice. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional customer actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice, such as failed payments, [SCA regulation](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication), or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method. If the PaymentIntent is not confirmed within 23 hours Subscriptions transition to `status=incomplete_expired`, which is a terminal state.
/// 
/// Use `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription's first invoice can't be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further customer action is needed, this parameter doesn't create a Subscription and returns an error instead. This was the default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the [changelog](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#2019-03-14) to learn more.
/// 
/// `pending_if_incomplete` is only used with updates and cannot be passed when creating a Subscription.
/// 
/// Subscriptions with `collection_method=send_invoice` are automatically activated regardless of the first Invoice status.
