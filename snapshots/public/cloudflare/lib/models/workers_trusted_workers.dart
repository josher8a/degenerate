/// Whether the Workers in the namespace are executed in a "trusted" manner. When a Worker is trusted, it has access to the shared caches for the zone in the Cache API, and has access to the `request.cf` object on incoming Requests. When a Worker is untrusted, caches are not shared across the zone, and `request.cf` is undefined. By default, Workers in a namespace are "untrusted".
