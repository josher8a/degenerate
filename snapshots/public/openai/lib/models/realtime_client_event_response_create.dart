import 'package:degenerate_runtime/degenerate_runtime.dart';import 'package:pub_openai/models/realtime_response_create_params.dart';/// This event instructs the server to create a Response, which means triggering
/// model inference. When in Server VAD mode, the server will create Responses
/// automatically.
/// 
/// A Response will include at least one Item, and may have two, in which case
/// the second will be a function call. These Items will be appended to the
/// conversation history by default.
/// 
/// The server will respond with a `response.created` event, events for Items
/// and content created, and finally a `response.done` event to indicate the
/// Response is complete.
/// 
/// The `response.create` event includes inference configuration like
/// `instructions` and `tools`. If these are set, they will override the Session's
/// configuration for this Response only.
/// 
/// Responses can be created out-of-band of the default Conversation, meaning that they can
/// have arbitrary input, and it's possible to disable writing the output to the Conversation.
/// Only one Response can write to the default Conversation at a time, but otherwise multiple
/// Responses can be created in parallel. The `metadata` field is a good way to disambiguate
/// multiple simultaneous Responses.
/// 
/// Clients can set `conversation` to `none` to create a Response that does not write to the default
/// Conversation. Arbitrary input can be provided with the `input` field, which is an array accepting
/// raw Items and references to existing Items.
